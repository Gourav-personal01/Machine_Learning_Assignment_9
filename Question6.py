# Q6. You are working for a travel agency, and your boss has asked you to analyze the Flight Price dataset
# to identify the peak travel season. What features would you analyze to identify the peak season, and how
# would you present your findings to your boss?

# Features to Analyze:

# Date or Month: Analyze the distribution of flight prices across different months or seasons to identify patterns in travel demand.

# Day of the Week: Check if flight prices vary based on the day of the week, as weekends and weekdays may have different travel trends.

# Holidays: Consider analyzing flight prices during holiday periods, as these often indicate peak travel seasons.

# Destination: Explore if certain destinations have higher demand during specific times of the year.

# Flight Duration: Analyze whether there are differences in flight prices for short-haul and long-haul flights, as longer trips may coincide with peak travel seasons.

# Special Events: Check if there are any major events (e.g., festivals, conferences, sports events) happening in specific months or locations that drive travel demand.
